# AndroidStudio
This repository is a technical documentation page about the Android Studio SDK.
I created this page for academic purposes after using Android Studio to develope a simple text editor application. 
It is intended to provide a general overview of some of the key feautures of the SDK, as well as provide some tips on 
coding applications on the platform.
